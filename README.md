### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a public policy professional conceptualizing solutions for digital and STEM education and workforce skills. My career has focused on the intersection between workforce skills, and educational technologies, particularly how we use data to track program outcomes. In my role as Director and Consultant at the East Brunswick FIRST Inc. I am conceptualizing solutions to address social problems such as persistent disparities, future of work and economic mobility. My most recent co-authored publication ca be found here:
